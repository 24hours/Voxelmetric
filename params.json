{"name":"Voxelmetric","tagline":"A voxel framework for Unity3d","body":"### What this is here for\r\nVoxelmetric is my attempt at creating a voxel framework that I update when I have the time. It's A learning experience and I'm making it all up as I go along. Feel free to use it to learn or use it in your game and if you make changes you think everyone would benefit from submit a pull request!\r\n\r\n### Aims\r\nThe project is far from feature complete, I'm aiming to get lighting and some easy to use terrain manipulation functions in place, then possibly a config file with feature toggles. I also know that people would like easier terrain generation so I'd like to add some tools for building terrain generation templates and the possibility of letting the world shift between terrain types by location.\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nI don't know what I'm doing. Things are liable to change, break or be really bad. Don't get upset if your game is relying on feature x and it gets scrapped/doesn't perform as fast as game y. Do help my out by submitting changes to make feature x work/perform faster than game y.\r\n\r\nSee [AlexSTV.com](AlexSTV.com) for updates.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
